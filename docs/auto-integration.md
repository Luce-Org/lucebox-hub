# Auto-integration manifest

Repository: `Luce-Org/lucebox-hub`
Integration branch: `auto-integration`
Writable remote: `easel`
Upstream remote: `origin` / `Luce-Org`
Last refresh: 2026-05-27T21:22:54-04:00 through 2026-05-27T21:29:00-04:00
Current stack tip before this metadata refresh: `d465a7e` (already aligned with `origin/main` `4f4d82e`; this run found no upstream-base advance and revalidated PR #237 with a fresh conflicted worktree plus tmux-driven Codex feasibility report).

## Included in the current stack

| PR | Head branch | State | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|
| #284 | `fix/draft-safetensors-rope-theta` | included | Current head `697198a` is an ancestor of the refreshed stack. |
| #276 | `fix/qwen36-claude-code-tool-calling` | included | Current head `0e3c79a` is an ancestor of the refreshed stack. |
| #274 | `feat/pflash-drafter-ee7` | included | Current head `5037b28` is an ancestor of the refreshed stack. |
| #266 | `feat/harness-typed-adapters` | included | Current head `17525ea` is an ancestor of the refreshed stack. |
| #152 | `main` | included | Current head `cf735be` is an ancestor of the refreshed stack. |
| #142 | `xabicasa/dflash-safetensors-draft-fp16` | included | Current head `f2fbf62` is an ancestor of the refreshed stack. |
| #174 | `split/gemma4-14-small-vram-docs` | selectively included | The docs-only VMM guidance remains ported to current `server/README.md` after the upstream README refresh. The older inherited Gemma4 commits on this branch are not cherry-picked. |
| #94 | `feat/dflash-qwen36-swa-draft` | absorbed / selectively included | Not an ancestor after the `dflash/` → `server/` migration, but its safetensors SWA config parsing and causal-mask support remain present under current draft/common code. |
| #62 | `fix/issue-55-stable-kv-pad` | absorbed / selectively included | Not an ancestor after layout migration, but the daemon reset regression test and follow-up daemon reset fixes remain carried. |
| #48 | `fix/consumer-blackwell-auto-detect` | superseded / selectively included | The old `dflash/CMakeLists.txt` change is obsolete; current `server/CMakeLists.txt` explicitly resolves CUDA architectures and carries Blackwell/GB10 handling. |
| #285 | `feat/lucebox-docker` | partially included / draft dependency | Draft PR, not part of the non-draft target, but an earlier head is carried as the Docker/CLI/bench integration dependency. Latest draft head `32961a1` is not required by any non-draft PR this run. |

## Attempted this run

| PR | Outcome | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
| #237 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr237-20260527-2124` produced broad conflicts across current `server/CMakeLists.txt`, common backend/MTP interfaces, Qwen35 loader/graph/backend files, tests, and deleted legacy `dflash/scripts/server.py` / `dflash/src/server/server_main.cpp`. tmux-driven Codex session `luce-pr237-codex-2124` wrote `/tmp/pr237-feasibility-20260527-2124.txt`: selective port is feasible, but a direct conflict-marker resolution is unsafe because the current native server CLI/config, Qwen35 MoE/remote-draft/thinking-budget behavior, and restore/prefix-cache semantics must be preserved with MTP off by default first. |
| #177 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr177-20260527-2020` produced conflicts in deleted legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, moved Gemma4 header/source/test paths, `server/src/errors.cpp`, and `server/src/internal.h`. A tmux-driven Claude assessment session was launched (`luce-pr177-claude-2020`) but exited without producing a report; the raw conflict shape still confirms this older Gemma4 KV-correctness split is not mechanically mergeable into the current `server/src/gemma4` architecture. |
| #153 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr153-20260527-2020` produced conflicts in legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, current `server/src/internal.h`, `server/src/qwen35/gguf_target_loader.cpp`, `server/src/qwen35/qwen35_target_graph.cpp`, and path-mapped MTP docs/tests. Codex tmux session `luce-pr153-codex-2020` wrote `/tmp/pr153-feasibility-20260527-2020.txt`: selective port is feasible, but not as conflict-marker resolution; current-layout loader/graph/token embedding/MoE/cache semantics need deliberate design. |
| #39 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr39-20260527-2020` produced broad conflicts across deleted legacy `dflash/*` files plus current draft graph/safetensors loader and MoE smoke tests. A tmux-driven Claude assessment session was launched (`luce-pr39-claude-2020`) but exited without producing a report; the branch remains an older MoE/DDTree stack that needs a survivorship review against current qwen35moe support. |
| #183 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr183-20260527-1959` produced unmerged paths across deleted legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, moved Gemma4 source/header files, `server/src/errors.cpp`, and `server/src/internal.h`. Codex tmux session `luce-pr183-codex-2003` wrote `/tmp/pr183-feasibility-20260527-1959.txt`: safe normal resolution is not feasible; PR #183 is an older Gemma4 MTP split-chain head whose direct semantic change needs a future current-layout MTP foundation port, likely after #237 or a replacement common MTP design. |
| #182 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr182-20260527-2039` conflicted on deleted legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, moved Gemma4 target/draft/MTP source and tests, `server/src/errors.cpp`, and `server/src/internal.h`. Claude exited without a report; Codex session `luce-pr182-codex2-20260527-2039` wrote `/tmp/pr182-feasibility-20260527-2039.txt`: the MTP assistant loader/step graph are portable only as a current-layout `server/src/gemma4` rewrite, not as direct conflict resolution. |
| #181 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr181-20260527-2039` hit the same old Gemma4 split-chain/current-layout boundary as #180/#182, including moved Gemma4 target/draft files, `server/src/errors.cpp`, and `server/src/internal.h`. It overlaps current Gemma4 DFlash backend and should be mined only after deciding the current Gemma4 MTP port shape. |
| #180 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr180-20260527-2039` conflicted on legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, moved Gemma4 target/draft files and tests, `server/src/errors.cpp`, and `server/src/internal.h`. Its draft-loader/quant pieces overlap current `server/src/gemma4` loader/backend work and are not mechanically mergeable. |
| #154 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr154-20260527-2039` conflicted in current Qwen35 loader/graph/test files plus old-layout MTP docs/scripts/tests. Codex session `luce-pr154-codex-20260527-2039` wrote `/tmp/pr154-feasibility-20260527-2039.txt`: the linear native MTP decode semantics are portable with moderate risk, but require a selective current-layout Qwen35 MTP design preserving current MoE/NVFP4/server abstractions. |
| #131 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr131-20260527-2039` produced broad conflicts across `.gitmodules`, deleted `dflash/*`, current Gemma4 source/test files, `server/src/internal.h`, `server/src/errors.cpp`, and pFlash adapter/test code. Claude exited without a report; Codex session `luce-pr131-codex2-20260527-2039` wrote `/tmp/pr131-feasibility-20260527-2039.txt`: broad Gemma4 support can be mined, but direct merge would reintroduce the old `dflash27b` API and obsolete build layout. |
| #137 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr137-20260527-2105` conflicted only on deleted legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`. Manual diff inspection shows the PR's single commit retargets the obsolete old CMake file; current `server/CMakeLists.txt` already owns CUDA architecture/BSA handling. Suggested close or author retarget to current `server/` layout. |
| #135 | not integrated | Fresh worktree merge probe in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr135-20260527-2105` conflicted in `server/src/internal.h`, `server/src/qwen35/qwen35_target_graph.cpp`, and `server/test/test_dflash.cpp` after path migration from old `dflash/*`. A tmux Codex session (`luce-pr135-codex-2105`) exited without a report file; a tmux Claude session (`luce-pr135-claude-2109`) hit the max-turn limit before producing a report. Manual diff review confirms the old multi-request scheduler/batched target-step concept is not mechanically mergeable and needs current `HttpServer`/`ModelBackend`/Qwen35 cache API design work. |
| upstream sync | checked | `origin/main` remains `4f4d82e`; `easel/auto-integration` was already based on that tip, so no upstream merge was needed this run. |

## Previously attempted / still not integrated

| PR | Head branch | State | Why held |
|---:|---|---|---|
| #237 | `feat/dflash-mtp-foundation` | attempted / blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr237-20260527-2124`; Codex report says selective current-layout MTP foundation port is feasible, but not by resolving the merge markers directly. First port current server MTP CLI/config with MTP off by default, preserve Qwen35 MoE/remote-draft/thinking-budget behavior, and defer or design restore/prefix-cache MTP warm semantics. |
| #221 | `feat/mtp-prefix-warm-ghost` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Prior direct + Codex attempts left many unmerged paths and legacy artifacts; depends on a coherent #237-style MTP foundation first. |
| #183 | `split/gemma4-11a-target-mtp-integration` | blocked-needs-human / superseded-by-current-architecture | Revalidated in the previous run. Its direct `h_prev` assertion has no current target location until Gemma4 MTP runtime is reintroduced in the current `server/src/gemma4` architecture. |
| #182 | `split/gemma4-10-mtp-loader-step-graph` | attempted / selective-port | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr182-20260527-2039`; Codex report says the assistant loader/MTP graph are portable only as current-layout `server/src/gemma4` work. |
| #181 | `split/gemma4-09-dflash-draft-runtime` | attempted / likely superseded | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr181-20260527-2039`; conflicts overlap current Gemma4 DFlash backend and the #182 MTP port decision. |
| #180 | `split/gemma4-08-draft-loader-quant` | attempted / likely superseded | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr180-20260527-2039`; conflicts overlap current Gemma4 loader/backend work and are not mechanically mergeable. |
| #177 | `split/gemma4-06-kv-correctness` | attempted / not mechanically mergeable | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr177-20260527-2020`; conflicts are on the old Gemma4 split-chain/current-layout boundary. Needs selective correctness review, not a branch merge. |
| #154 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-speculative-loop` | attempted / selective-port | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr154-20260527-2039`; Codex report says the linear native MTP decode semantics are portable with moderate risk, but require current-layout Qwen35 MTP design work. |
| #153 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-integrated` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr153-20260527-2020`; Codex report says a current-layout Qwen35 MTP port is feasible but needs loader/graph/cache/MoE design rather than a mechanical merge. |
| #137 | `xabicasa/dflash-build-cmake-sm89-bsa` | attempted / stale | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr137-20260527-2105`; conflicts only on deleted legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`. Current `server/CMakeLists.txt` supersedes it. Suggested close unless re-targeted to current server layout. |
| #135 | `xabicasa/dflash-multi-request-scheduler-batched-target-step` | attempted / selective-port | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr135-20260527-2105`; direct merge conflicts in current `server/src/internal.h`, `server/src/qwen35/qwen35_target_graph.cpp`, and `server/test/test_dflash.cpp`. The old scheduler semantics require current-tree scheduler/cache API design, not conflict-marker resolution. |
| #131 | `feature/gemma4-support` | attempted / selective-port | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr131-20260527-2039`; Codex report says broad Gemma4 support can be mined, but direct merge would resurrect old `dflash27b`/`dflash/` layout. |
| #39 | `feat/moe-35b-a3b` | attempted / likely superseded | Revalidated this run in `/tmp/luce-attempt-pr39-20260527-2020`; direct merge conflicts with current qwen35moe/draft graph work. Needs a MoE/DDTree survivorship review rather than a branch merge. |

## Draft / excluded

Draft PRs remain outside the primary contributor integration target: #289, #286, #285, #278, #275, #273, #265, #249, #193, #75. #285 remains partially carried only as an integration dependency.

## Suggested close / author action

- #137: close or ask author to re-target current `server/CMakeLists.txt`.
- #48: close as superseded by current CUDA architecture/Blackwell handling unless the author has a specific missing Blackwell case.
- #237: keep open for a deliberate current-layout MTP foundation port; direct merge is unsafe, but the Codex report identifies a viable compile-first path with MTP disabled by default.
- #183/#182/#181/#180/#177/#154/#153/#131/#39: do not close solely as conflicts yet; ask authors or maintainers to identify which current-layout Gemma4/MTP pieces are still intended after the newer `server/src/gemma4` architecture and #237 direction.
