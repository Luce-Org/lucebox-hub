# Auto-integration manifest

Repository: `Luce-Org/lucebox-hub`
Integration branch: `auto-integration`
Writable remote: `easel`
Upstream remote: `origin` / `Luce-Org`
Last refresh: 2026-05-28T17:05:19-04:00
Current base: `origin/main` `cfdd2fd5`
Current integration tip before this refresh: `easel/auto-integration` `9e89ce5f`
Refreshed stack tip prepared in this run: this commit

This branch is maintained as a reproducible patch stack over `origin/main`.
The primary checkout was clean at the start of this unattended run. Since the
previous refresh, `origin/main` remained at `cfdd2fd5` and new non-draft
contributor PRs #301 and #302 opened against `main`. This run created an
isolated worktree from fetched `easel/auto-integration`, confirmed the upstream
base was already an ancestor, merged #301, pushed once, then the required
post-push re-enumeration found #302 and the same worktree merged it cleanly. The
run then re-checked the remaining open non-draft contributor PRs. All currently
mergeable non-draft contributor PRs are now included in the stack; the remaining
non-ancestor PRs still require current-layout selective ports or are superseded.

## Included in the current stack

| PR | Head branch | Head | State | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| #302 | `fix/harness-model-paths` | `ea40732` | included | Client harness launchers now honor `DFLASH_TARGET`/`DFLASH_DRAFT`, validate target/draft paths before spawning servers, and document model path overrides. |
| #301 | `fix/ddtree-test-harness` | `1b3882d` | included | DDTree test harness now reads full verify logits, computes the posterior on CPU instead of relying on the tree GPU argmax shortcut, reuses the logits buffer for sampler bonus logits, and counts generated tokens before the early-exit path. |
| #300 | `fix/sigterm-gpu-unload` | upstream | included through upstream | `origin/main` now includes the SIGTERM GPU-unload fix via merge commit `a308008a`. |

| #142 | `xabicasa/dflash-safetensors-draft-fp16` | `f2fbf62` | included | FP16 safetensors drafter support is carried. |
| #285 | `feat/lucebox-docker` | draft | partial draft dependency | Draft PR, outside the non-draft target, but earlier Docker/CLI/bench integration dependency remains carried. |

## Fresh probe results from this run

| PR | Outcome | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
| upstream sync | checked | `origin/main` remains `cfdd2fd5`; it was already an ancestor of fetched `easel/auto-integration` `9e89ce5f` before this refresh. |
| #302 | integrated | Required post-push re-enumeration found new PR #302. `git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/pr/302` merged cleanly in the same isolated worktree and was committed as `cf0288f6`. The patch touches `README.md`, `harness/clients/README.md`, and `harness/clients/common.sh`. |
| #301 | integrated | `git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/pr/301` merged cleanly in the isolated worktree and was committed as `3bb44301`. The patch is limited to `server/test/test_dflash.cpp`. |
| current integrated PRs | checked | `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/pr/<n> HEAD` passed for open non-draft PRs #302, #301, #295, #294, #292, #289, #276, #274, #266, #152, and #142. #298/#299/#300 are included through `origin/main`. |
| #237 | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Direct merge still conflicts across moved legacy `dflash/` paths, common MTP interfaces, Qwen35 backend/graph/loader files, CMake, daemon/server wiring, and tests. A fresh tmux-driven Codex feasibility pass (`/tmp/luce-pr237-codex-20260528-1643.txt`) used read-only inspection and concluded direct merge is unsafe; current-layout salvage is valuable but non-trivial because current `server/src` still lacks `MtpSource`, `IMtpModule`, `Qwen35MtpModule`, `--mtp-*`, and MTP backend support. |
| #221 | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Direct merge still conflicts across prefix-cache/MTP/common/Qwen35 files and tests. It depends on a current-layout #237-equivalent MTP foundation before a useful port can be made. |
| #154 | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Direct merge conflicts in old `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, MTP docs, old internal/target graph paths, and MTP smoke/contract tests. Portable only after the current-layout Qwen35 MTP foundation exists. |
| #153 | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Same old-layout MTP integrated runtime conflict class as #154; requires current-layout loader/graph/cache design work. |
| #137 | suggested-close/superseded | Direct merge conflicts only in legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`; current `server/CMakeLists.txt` owns CUDA arch/BSA handling. |
| #135 | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Direct merge conflicts in old internal/Qwen35 target graph/test paths. Needs current multi-request scheduler design rather than direct conflict resolution. |
| #94 | suggested-close/superseded | Direct merge conflicts in draft graph/safetensors loader/old internal paths. Current code already carries the useful SWA draft parsing and causal-mask behavior; remaining branch edits are old-layout. |
| #48 | suggested-close/superseded | Direct merge conflicts only in legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`; current server CMake supersedes the old Blackwell arch detection patch. |

## Pending / blocked-needs-human / selective-port candidates

| PR | Head branch | Current status | Next useful action |
|---:|---|---|---|
| #237 | `feat/dflash-mtp-foundation` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Create a fresh current-layout port from `auto-integration`: add MTP core under `server/src/common` and `server/src/qwen35`, wire CMake disabled-by-default, then port hidden capture, rollback, CLI, and tests while preserving current pFlash, remote-draft, and reasoning-budget behavior. |
| #221 | `feat/mtp-prefix-warm-ghost` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Revisit after #237-equivalent MTP foundation; then port hidden-state/speculator hooks, backend dispatcher, daemon wiring, and WARM tests to current `server/` layout. |
| #154 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-speculative-loop` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Mine linear MTP decode semantics after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #153 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-integrated` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Mine loader/graph/cache/test ideas after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #135 | `xabicasa/dflash-multi-request-scheduler-batched-target-step` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Port only after designing current multi-slot `Qwen35Backend` state and scheduler API. |
| #137 | `xabicasa/dflash-build-cmake-sm89-bsa` | suggested-close/superseded | Ask author to close or retarget to current `server/CMakeLists.txt` if anything remains. |
| #94 | `feat/dflash-qwen36-swa-draft` | suggested-close/superseded | Useful behavior appears absorbed; ask author/maintainers whether any remaining old-layout tests should be reauthored before close. |
| #48 | `fix/consumer-blackwell-auto-detect` | suggested-close/superseded | Close or retarget to current `server/CMakeLists.txt` if still needed. |

## Draft / excluded

Draft PRs remain outside the primary non-draft integration target except for
dependency awareness: #297, #291, #290, #286, #285, #275, #249, #193, and #75.
#286 is the draft PR for the current auto-integration snapshot.

## Validation run

This run performed:

- `date -Is` -> 2026-05-28T17:05:19-04:00 at preflight; manifest refresh timestamp 2026-05-28T17:05:19-04:00.
- Primary checkout `/home/erik/Projects/luce2` `git status --short` was clean before work began.
- `git branch --show-current` reported `auto-integration` in the primary checkout.
- `git remote -v` verified `origin=https://github.com/Luce-Org/lucebox-hub` and `easel=https://github.com/easel/lucebox-hub`.
- `GH_CONFIG_DIR=/home/erik/.config/gh XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/erik/.config HOME=/home/erik gh auth status` succeeded for account `easel` with repo/workflow scopes.
- `HOME=/home/erik /home/erik/.local/bin/claude auth status --text` succeeded for the Claude Team account.
- `HOME=/home/erik /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/codex --version` completed successfully with `codex-cli 0.130.0`.
- `git fetch --prune origin` and `git fetch --prune easel` completed separately; targeted fetches recreated open non-draft contributor PR refs.
- Worktree `/tmp/luce-auto-cron-20260528-170548` was created from `easel/auto-integration` `9e89ce5f`.
- `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD` returned `0 333` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD` passed before merging #301.
- `git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/pr/301` succeeded cleanly; commit `3bb44301` integrated #301.
- Initial push to `easel/auto-integration` succeeded, advancing the branch to `89dcc469`; required post-push PR re-enumeration then found new non-draft PR #302.
- `git fetch origin pull/302/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/302` succeeded, and `git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/pr/302` merged cleanly; commit `cf0288f6` integrated #302.
- Isolated direct probes attempted `git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/pr/<n>` for #237, #221, #154, #153, #137, #135, #94, and #48; each conflicted and was aborted in the worktree. Log: `/tmp/luce-merge-probes-20260528-1705.txt`.
- Ancestor checks passed for included open non-draft contributor PR refs #302, #301, #295, #294, #292, #289, #276, #274, #266, #152, and #142.
- `bash -n harness/clients/common.sh`, `git diff --check`, ancestor checks, and the targeted conflict-marker scan over `docs/auto-integration.md`, `server/test/test_dflash.cpp`, `README.md`, `harness/clients/README.md`, and `harness/clients/common.sh` passed before this manifest commit.
- A local shell smoke check for #302's model-path selection/failure behavior was attempted but blocked by the unattended command-safety guard before execution, so the run did not retry it.
- GitHub checks for draft PR #286 were inspected before push; `uv workspace` passed while `cuda12` and `Build (cmake + uv sync --extra megakernel)` were pending.
- Push status is recorded after this manifest commit and final push attempt.

## Notes

- The primary checkout is clean but its local `auto-integration` branch remains at `89f80c58`, diverged from fetched `easel/auto-integration`; the pushed `easel/auto-integration` branch remains source of truth until supervised local branch cleanup.
- Retained worktree `/tmp/luce-auto-cron-20260528-170548`, direct-probe log `/tmp/luce-merge-probes-20260528-1705.txt`, and earlier Codex report `/tmp/luce-pr237-codex-20260528-1643.txt`.
- Prior retained worktrees, probe logs, agent reports, and configure directories remain as listed in earlier manifest revisions; cleanup is separate maintenance.
