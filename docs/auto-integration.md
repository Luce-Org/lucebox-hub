# Auto-integration manifest

Repository: `Luce-Org/lucebox-hub`
Integration branch: `auto-integration`
Writable remote: `easel`
Upstream remote: `origin` / `Luce-Org`
Last refresh: 2026-05-28T21:59:29-04:00
Current base: `origin/main` `8782d07a`
Current integration tip before this refresh: `easel/auto-integration` `a139fb53`
Refreshed stack merge commit prepared in this run: none; stack already current
Final manifest commit prepared after stack merge: this commit

This branch is maintained as a reproducible patch stack over `origin/main`.
The upstream base, writable remote tip, and carried contributor PR heads were
already current at the start of this unattended run. This refresh revalidated
the open PR set, fetched current pull refs, and confirmed the carried
non-draft PR heads remain ancestors of the integration tip. No new non-draft
contributor PR head appeared during the run, so no source stack rewrite was
needed.

## Included in the current stack

| PR | Head branch | Head | State | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| #303 | `fix/harness-portable-run-dirs` | upstream `05b008a0` | included through upstream and stack | Harness portable run/cache directories and automatic client-install fallback are in `origin/main`; the stack preserved local compatibility docs and helpers. |
| #302 | `fix/harness-model-paths` | upstream | included through upstream | Harness launcher model-path override behavior and documentation are in `origin/main`. |
| #301 | `fix/ddtree-test-harness` | upstream | included through upstream | DDTree test harness fixes are in `origin/main`. |
| #300 | `fix/sigterm-gpu-unload` | upstream | included through upstream | SIGTERM GPU-unload fix remains in upstream. |
| #299 | `feat/draft-swa-flag` | upstream | included through upstream | Draft SWA env/flag support remains in upstream. |
| #298 | `fix/gemma4-destructor-link` | upstream | included through upstream | Gemma4 destructor-link fix remains in upstream. |
| #292 | `feat-backend-ipc-payload-pipe-open` | upstream / `90bc52f` | included through upstream and stack | `origin/main` carries backend IPC payload-pipe support; the stack already contained the same PR head before it landed upstream. |
| #297 | `feat-server-laguna-layer-split-adapter-v2` | `53dd1686` | included / now draft | Laguna target-layer-split adapter remains carried in the easel stack. The GitHub PR is currently draft, so it is excluded from the non-draft target but retained as an already-carried dependency. |
| #295 | `fix-layer-split-sampling` | `a9aedf7d` | included | Target layer-split sampling support remains an ancestor of the stack. |
| #294 | `feat/server-passthrough-proxy` | `0883c2ef` | included | Server passthrough proxy wiring, piecewise keep-ratio curve, query survival checks, and unit coverage are carried. |
| #289 | `pipeline_moe` | `0ffab8a1` | included | Pipelined hybrid Qwen35 MoE decode update remains an ancestor of the stack. |
| #276 | `fix/qwen36-claude-code-tool-calling` | `5e861b4d` | included | Qwen3.6-27B tool-calling fix for Claude-code Anthropic path is carried. |
| #274 | `feat/pflash-drafter-ee7` | `e64a2b80` | included | Adaptive pFlash composition, EE7/drafter updates, docs, tests, and follow-up fixes are carried. |
| #266 | `feat/harness-typed-adapters` | `17525eae` | included | Typed harness adapters and format-aware session-inject proxy are carried. |
| #152 | `main` | `cf735bee` | included | Gemma 4 RTX 4090 backend helpers are carried. |
| #142 | `xabicasa/dflash-safetensors-draft-fp16` | `f2fbf62f` | included | FP16 safetensors drafter support is carried. |
| #285 | `feat/lucebox-docker` | draft | partial draft dependency | Draft PR, outside the primary non-draft target, but earlier Docker/CLI/bench integration dependency remains partially carried. The current draft head `82ebf982` is not fully an ancestor. |

## Validation run

This run performed:

- `date -Is` -> 2026-05-28T21:59:29-04:00 for the run timestamp.
- `git fetch --prune origin` and `git fetch --prune easel` completed successfully.
- `gh pr list --repo Luce-Org/lucebox-hub --state open --limit 30 --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,isDraft,author,updatedAt,labels` refreshed the open PR set; the only new observation versus the previous manifest is draft #304.
- `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD` reports `0` behind and `367` ahead.
- `git merge-base --is-ancestor` checks still pass for carried open non-draft PR refs: #295, #294, #289, #276, #274, #266, #152, and #142. Draft #297 also remains an ancestor.
- `origin/main` remains the current upstream base; no source stack rewrite was needed.

## Pending / blocked-needs-human / selective-port candidates

| PR | Head branch | Current status | Next useful action |
|---:|---|---|---|
| #237 | `feat/dflash-mtp-foundation` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | First port only the common MTP API surface to `server/src/common`: no-op `DFlashTarget`/`ModelBackend` hooks, `mtp_interface`, chain runner/orchestrator, CMake entries, and `test_common_mtp_orchestrator`; after that compiles, port Qwen35 MTP graph/loader/runtime while preserving current remote-draft, pFlash, layer-split, thinking-budget, telemetry, and MoE hooks. |
| #221 | `feat/mtp-prefix-warm-ghost` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Revisit after #237-equivalent MTP foundation; then port hidden-state/speculator hooks, backend dispatcher, daemon wiring, and WARM tests to current `server/` layout. |
| #154 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-speculative-loop` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Mine linear MTP decode semantics after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #153 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-integrated` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Mine loader/graph/cache/test ideas after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #135 | `xabicasa/dflash-multi-request-scheduler-batched-target-step` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Design a current-layout multi-request scheduler in the qwen35 daemon/graph-builder layer, including multi-request state ownership, batched `n_seqs` target stepping, copy-in/copy-back validation, and tagged streaming. Do not resurrect the old monolithic `test_dflash.cpp` scheduler mechanically. |
| #137 | `xabicasa/dflash-build-cmake-sm89-bsa` | suggested-close/superseded | Ask author to close or retarget to current `server/CMakeLists.txt` if anything remains. |
| #94 | `feat/dflash-qwen36-swa-draft` | suggested-close/superseded | Useful behavior appears absorbed; ask author/maintainers whether any remaining old-layout tests should be reauthored before close. |
| #48 | `fix/consumer-blackwell-auto-detect` | suggested-close/superseded | Close or retarget to current `server/CMakeLists.txt` if still needed. |

## Draft / excluded

Draft PRs remain outside the primary non-draft integration target except for
ongoing dependency awareness: #304, #297, #291, #290, #286, #285, #275, #249,
and #193. #286 is the draft PR for the current auto-integration snapshot. #304
is a draft LLM auto context compaction PR observed again in this run; it was not
integrated because it is draft.

## Notes

This run produced a manifest-only refresh on top of `a139fb53`; no source stack rewrite was needed because `origin/main`, `easel/auto-integration`, and all carried non-draft PR heads were unchanged.
Prior probe logs and earlier conflict-triage notes remain valid for the still-blocked PRs listed above; no new direct-merge evidence changed their classification this run.
