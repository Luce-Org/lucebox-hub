# Auto-integration manifest

Repository: `Luce-Org/lucebox-hub`
Integration branch: `auto-integration`
Writable remote: `easel`
Upstream remote: `origin` / `Luce-Org`
Last refresh: 2026-05-28T17:42:06-04:00
Current base: `origin/main` `6691d3b4`
Current integration tip before this refresh: `easel/auto-integration` `faf8165e`
Refreshed stack tip prepared in this run: merge commit `dd5e556e`

This branch is maintained as a reproducible patch stack over `origin/main`.
The primary checkout was clean at the start of this unattended run. Since the
previous refresh, `origin/main` advanced from `9ed3c155` to `6691d3b4` by
merging PR #292. The existing `easel/auto-integration` stack already contained
that PR head, so an isolated worktree merge of `origin/main` completed with no
new tree changes. The local checkout then recorded a merge commit to keep
ancestry aligned with upstream.

All currently direct-mergeable non-draft contributor PRs are included in the
stack. Remaining non-ancestor PRs still conflict in old-layout MTP/scheduler or
superseded CMake/draft areas and require selective current-layout ports rather
than direct merges.

## Included in the current stack

| PR | Head branch | Head | State | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| #302 | `fix/harness-model-paths` | upstream | included through upstream | Harness launcher model-path override behavior and documentation are in `origin/main`. |
| #301 | `fix/ddtree-test-harness` | upstream | included through upstream | DDTree test harness fixes are in `origin/main`. |
| #300 | `fix/sigterm-gpu-unload` | upstream | included through upstream | SIGTERM GPU-unload fix remains in upstream. |

| #292 | `feat-backend-ipc-payload-pipe-open` | upstream / `90bc52f` | included through upstream and stack | `origin/main` now carries backend IPC payload-pipe support; the stack already contained the same PR head. |
| #295 | `fix-layer-split-sampling` | `a9aedf7d` | included | Target layer-split sampling support remains an ancestor of the stack. |
| #294 | `feat/server-passthrough-proxy` | `0883c2e` | included | Server passthrough proxy wiring, piecewise keep-ratio curve, query survival checks, and unit coverage are carried. |
| #289 | `pipeline_moe` | `0ffab8a` | included | Pipelined hybrid Qwen35 MoE decode update is carried; inaccessible submodule history remains excluded. |
| #276 | `fix/qwen36-claude-code-tool-calling` | `5e861b4` | included | Qwen3.6-27B tool-calling fix for Claude-code Anthropic path is carried. |

| #285 | `feat/lucebox-docker` | draft | partial draft dependency | Draft PR, outside the non-draft target, but earlier Docker/CLI/bench integration dependency remains carried. |

## Fresh probe results from this run

| PR | Outcome | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
|| upstream sync | merged cleanly | `git merge --no-ff --no-edit origin/main` in the primary checkout created merge commit `dd5e556e` with no tree changes because PR #292 was already carried before it landed upstream. |
|| current integrated PRs | checked | `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/pr/<n> HEAD` passed for open non-draft PRs #295, #294, #289, #276, #274, #266, #152, and #142. #292/#298/#299/#300/#301/#302 are included through `origin/main`. |
| #237 | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Direct merge still conflicts across moved legacy `dflash/` server paths, CMake, backend factory, common MTP interfaces/orchestrator, Qwen35 backend/graph/loader files, and tests. A current-layout MTP foundation port remains the next useful action. |
| #221 | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Direct merge still conflicts across old prefix-cache/MTP/common/Qwen35 files, server tests, and legacy script paths. It depends on a current-layout #237-equivalent MTP foundation before a useful port can be made. |
| #154 | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Direct merge conflicts in legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`, MTP docs, `server/src/internal.h`, Qwen35 loader/target graph, and MTP smoke/contract tests. Portable only after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #153 | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Same old-layout MTP integrated runtime conflict class as #154; requires current-layout loader/graph/cache design work. |
| #137 | suggested-close/superseded | Direct merge conflicts only in legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`; current `server/CMakeLists.txt` owns CUDA arch/BSA handling. |
| #135 | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Direct merge conflicts in `server/src/internal.h`, `server/src/qwen35/qwen35_target_graph.cpp`, and `server/test/test_dflash.cpp`. Needs current multi-request scheduler design rather than direct conflict resolution. |
| #94 | suggested-close/superseded | Direct merge conflicts in current draft graph/safetensors loader/internal files. Current code already carries the useful SWA draft parsing and causal-mask behavior; remaining branch edits are old-layout/obsolete. |
| #48 | suggested-close/superseded | Direct merge conflicts only in legacy `dflash/CMakeLists.txt`; current server CMake supersedes the old Blackwell arch detection patch. |

## Pending / blocked-needs-human / selective-port candidates

| PR | Head branch | Current status | Next useful action |
|---:|---|---|---|
| #237 | `feat/dflash-mtp-foundation` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Create a fresh current-layout port from `auto-integration`: add MTP core under `server/src/common` and `server/src/qwen35`, wire CMake disabled-by-default, then port hidden capture, rollback, CLI, and tests while preserving current pFlash, remote-draft, and reasoning-budget behavior. |
| #221 | `feat/mtp-prefix-warm-ghost` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Revisit after #237-equivalent MTP foundation; then port hidden-state/speculator hooks, backend dispatcher, daemon wiring, and WARM tests to current `server/` layout. |
| #154 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-speculative-loop` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Mine linear MTP decode semantics after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #153 | `xabicasa/dflash-mtp-integrated` | blocked-needs-human / dependency | Mine loader/graph/cache/test ideas after current-layout Qwen35 MTP exists. |
| #135 | `xabicasa/dflash-multi-request-scheduler-batched-target-step` | blocked-needs-human / selective-port | Port only after designing current multi-slot `Qwen35Backend` state and scheduler API. |
| #137 | `xabicasa/dflash-build-cmake-sm89-bsa` | suggested-close/superseded | Ask author to close or retarget to current `server/CMakeLists.txt` if anything remains. |
| #94 | `feat/dflash-qwen36-swa-draft` | suggested-close/superseded | Useful behavior appears absorbed; ask author/maintainers whether any remaining old-layout tests should be reauthored before close. |
| #48 | `fix/consumer-blackwell-auto-detect` | suggested-close/superseded | Close or retarget to current `server/CMakeLists.txt` if still needed. |

## Draft / excluded

Draft PRs remain outside the primary non-draft integration target except for
dependency awareness: #297, #291, #290, #286, #285, #275, #249, and #193.
#286 is the draft PR for the current auto-integration snapshot.

## Validation run

This run performed:

- `date -Is` -> 2026-05-28T17:42:06-04:00 for the final sync/push timestamp.
- Primary checkout `/home/erik/Projects/luce2` was clean before the upstream sync step.
- `git fetch --prune origin` and `git fetch --prune easel` completed separately; targeted fetches recreated open non-draft contributor PR refs.
- Worktree `/tmp/luce-auto-cron-20260528-173715` was created from `easel/auto-integration` `dd4c82b1` for isolated direct PR probes.
- `git merge --no-ff --no-commit origin/main` in the worktree completed with no conflicts and no tree changes because PR #292 was already carried before it landed upstream.
- The primary checkout then recorded `git merge --no-ff --no-edit origin/main`, producing merge commit `dd5e556e` with no content changes.
- Isolated direct probes attempted `git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/pr/<n>` for #237, #221, #154, #153, #137, #135, #94, and #48; each conflicted and was aborted in the worktree. Logs: `/tmp/luce-merge-probes-20260528-173715.txt` and `/tmp/luce-merge-probe-237-20260528-173715.txt`.
- Ancestor checks passed for included open non-draft contributor PR refs #295, #294, #289, #276, #274, #266, #152, and #142.
- `bash -n harness/clients/common.sh`, `git diff --check`, and an anchored conflict-marker scan (`git grep -n -E '^(<<<<<<<|>>>>>>>|=======)( |$)' -- . ':!server/eval/humaneval_plus/humanevalplus.jsonl'`) passed after the manifest refresh.
- `git push easel auto-integration` updated the writable remote to the latest auto-integration head.

## Notes

- Retained worktree `/tmp/luce-auto-cron-20260528-173715` and direct-probe logs `/tmp/luce-merge-probes-20260528-173715.txt`, `/tmp/luce-merge-probe-237-20260528-173715.txt`.
- Prior retained worktrees, probe logs, agent reports, and configure directories remain as listed in earlier manifest revisions; cleanup is separate maintenance.
